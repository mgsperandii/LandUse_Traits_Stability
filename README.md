# LandUse_Traits_Stability
This repository contains R scripts and datasets to replicate the results presented in the manuscript **"Functional traits mediate the effect of land use on drivers of community stability within and across trophic levels."**

# Data
The file "LandUse_Traits_Stability_Datasets.RData" includes datasets for plants, total arthropods, herbivores, and carnivores in both grasslands and forests (total: 8 datasets). Please note that all numeric variables have already been centered and scaled.

# Scripts
The file "LandUse_Traits_Stability_RCode.R" is the script used to reproduce the analyses presented in the manuscript. Within this script, analyses are organized according to the hypotheses they address, specifically in the following order:

Structural Equation Models (SEM) to explore the role of functional traits in mediating land-use effects on community drivers within taxonomic/trophic levels (addressing the first hypothesis, H1).
Structural Equation Models (SEM) to explore the role of functional traits in mediating land-use effects on community drivers across taxonomic/trophic levels (addressing the second hypothesis, H2).
